/** 
 * TypeScript interfaces can be used for several purposes
 * can be used to define 
    * abstract type that can be implemented by concrete classes 
    * any structure
    * define contracts made available by third-party libraries and frameworks that are not written in TypeScript
  
 * Interfaces are declared with the interface keyword and contain a series of annotations to describe the contract that they represent 
 * The annotations describe properties and functions, as you might expect, and constructors and indexers, which are not as common in other languages 
 * When writing interfaces to describe classes you intend to implement in your program, you wonâ€™t need to define constructors or indexers 
 * These features are included to help you describe external code with structures that may not be analogous to classes 
 * Constructors are declared using the new keyword.
