/**
 * Scope determines the 
    * lifespan
    * access
    * visibility of variables, functions, and objects throughout code
 * Scope Benefits, including:
    * Security — Variables and functions are only accessible where they are needed
    * Reducing Namespace Collisions — Namespace collisions occur when two or more variables share a common name
    * Scoping of variables helps reduce global variables which prevents this from occurring
    * Code Reusability — Correctly utilizing local scopes means more reusable code with fewer potential side-effects
    * At the most basic level, there are two types of scope
            - Global Scope
            - Local Scope
* Global Scope: global scope — functions, variables, etc. are accessible anywhere within your JavaScript code. Global variables are also available for the lifetime of your application and only deleted when the application ends (or when you close the browser window)  
* Local Scope: Whenever we create a new scope within the global scope, we are creating a local scope. Locally scoped variables are only accessible where they are defined (within their local scope)
